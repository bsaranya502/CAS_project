Overview - GSD
----------------------------------
Our project is to build the automation test for the GSD module in the One Cognizant web page . We have developed this using Selenium with the TestNG framework. We used Selenium Java for automation purposes; we wrote scripts in Java and integrated them with frameworks like TestNG and Apache POI. As a team of five, we divided the modules among ourselves and completed the project successfully. With the help of our mentors and coach, we were able to clarify our doubts and complete the project
